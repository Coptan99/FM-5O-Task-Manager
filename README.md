This project is Open Source Software (OSS) which is done by us as an In Real Life (IRL) example on applying the Project Managemet course in our college.

## Can anyone use this project?
Yes, of course anyone can use this project and also collaborate with us! help in it's development by doing PR :)

## Tools used in this project
Until now we only used:
### 1- Qt designer
to generate our ui files as *.xml file to be loaded in our code.
### 2- PyInstaller
to compile our code to *.exe (for windows) and *.sh (for linux).

## Can this project grow one day?
Yes, why not? we will complete this project using Project Management principles to expand it further.

## What are the differences between this project and alternatives?
This project is very simple (also works offline), we developed it only to be used as a simple task manager used during long development workflow
It also saves all files locally, no cloud necessary.
